Based on the examples I see, Console Logs are used when users experience problems like: - **API timeouts and connection issues** - Such as severe latency, call failures, or slow response times from Mojo's servers - **Session management problems** - Like sessions ending unexpectedly during live calls or needing session timeout adjustments The Console Log appears to be a diagnostic tool that generates a unique URL (like the examples shown: `https://app41.mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/671020/` or `https://app451.mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/101794/`) that contains technical information about your account's activity and any errors. When you contact Mojo support with technical issues, they may ask you to provide or generate a Console Log to help them diagnose the problem more effectively. If you're experiencing technical difficulties with Mojo, you would typically contact support and they can guide you on how to access or generate the appropriate Console Log for your specific issue. Is there a particular technical issue you're experiencing that might require Console Log diagnostics?",5,2,

To help troubleshoot this problem, I'll need a bit more information about what specifically is happening. Here are some common solutions to try: **Network Connection Issues:** First, check that your network has the required ports open. The Mojo Dialer needs these specific ports to function properly: - Port 20708 (TCP/IP) - Port 20808 (TCP/IP) - Port 20718 (TCP/IP) - Port 20818 (TCP/IP) Make sure your firewall allows both inbound and outbound traffic on these ports. If you're using a VPN or proxy, verify it's not blocking these ports. **Basic Troubleshooting Steps:** 1. **Restart your session:** Try stopping your current dialing session and starting a new one 2. **Check your connection method:** Ensure you're properly connected to the dialing server by either: - Waiting for the incoming call at your specified number (if using ""Call Me"" feature) - Calling the provided phone number and entering your PIN when prompted 3. **Verify your settings:** Make sure your Power Dialer configuration is set up correctly with proper Caller ID and call settings **If the issue persists:** - Restart your computer and network equipment - Test your general internet connection - Contact your network administrator if you're on a business network Can you tell me more specifically what's happening? For example: - Are you unable to start a dialing session? - Is the dialer connecting but calls aren't going through? - Are you getting any specific error messages?

When I’ve already mapped an area, I’d love the ability to reselect that exact same mapped area later, but apply different filters to it, without having to redraw the map. This would work similar to how “Manage Mapping” functions in N","2026-02-01T18:28:38.000Z","Closed","I understand you'd like the ability to reselect previously mapped areas and apply different filters without having to redraw the map boundaries. This would function similarly to the ""Manage Mapping"" feature in Neighborhood Search, where you could return to the same farm area but adjust criteria like price range, beds/baths, equity, or absentee ownership for more targeted prospecting. This is indeed a valuable feature request that would save time and improve efficiency for users who work the same geographic areas with different targeting strategies. While I don't see this feature currently available in the system, your request has been noted. Feature requests like this help Mojo prioritize development based on user needs. In the meantime, you would need to redraw your map areas when you want to apply different filters to the same geographic region. Is there a particular workflow or frequency where this feature would be most beneficial for your prospecting activities?",5,2,
