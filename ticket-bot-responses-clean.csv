Based on the support tickets I have access to, this appears to be a common type of problem that users encounter. To help you troubleshoot your dialer issue, I'll need a bit more information about what specifically you're experiencing. However, here are some common solutions to try: ## Quick Troubleshooting Steps: 1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure the required network ports are open on your firewall: - Ports 20708, 20808, 20718, 20818 (TCP/IP) must be open for proper Mojo Dialer communication - Reference: [Required Network Ports article](https://mojodialersupport.mojosells.com/portal/en/kb/articles/required-network-ports-for-mojo-dialer) 2. **Verify Your Setup**: - Confirm your account subscription is active - Check that your dialer settings are configured properly - Ensure you have contacts imported to call 3. **Connection Method**: Try connecting to the dialing server using: - Wait for incoming call - Use Mojo Voice (browser-based connection) - Check your selected calling method in settings ## What specific error or behavior are you seeing? - Is the dialer not starting at all? - Are you getting connection errors? - Are calls not connecting properly? - Is there a specific error message displayed? Please share more details about the exact issue you're encountering, and I can provide more targeted assistance based on the [Power Dialer usage guide](https://mojodialersupport.mojosells.com/portal/en/kb/articles/using-the-power-dialer) and configuration options.",3,2,

Here's what I can help clarify: **Regarding address types in map mode:** From the support tickets, one user asked whether map mode only shows residential addresses or if business addresses also appear. While I don't have the specific answer to this in my documentation, this appears to be a common question. **Map mode troubleshooting:** I can see there was a ticket where map mode wasn't working despite having correct property addresses (PIN: 754196). **Related mapping features:** Mojo does offer several map-based tools: - **Neighborhood Search** - A map-based prospecting tool that lets you draw areas (radius, street-based, or freeform) to find leads in specific locations - This tool is great for circle prospecting, finding leads near sold properties, or targeting specific neighborhoods Could you provide more details about your specific map mode question? For example: - Are you having trouble with map mode not displaying properly? - Are you wondering about what types of addresses show up? - Or is this related to the Neighborhood Search mapping feature? This will help me give you a more targeted answer or direct you to the right support resources.",3,2,

While I can see from support tickets that callback forwarding is definitely a feature that Mojo supports, I don't have the specific pricing information or detailed setup process for purchasing additional numbers in the documentation provided. For accurate information about: - Cost of purchasing a new number within Mojo - The specific process for setting up callback forwarding to a separate agent number - Available number options and configurations I'd recommend reaching out to Mojo support directly, as they'll have the most current pricing and can walk you through the exact setup process for your specific needs. From the support tickets I can see, callback routing is configurable - you can set up forwarding so that callbacks go to different numbers rather than your main line, which is exactly what you're looking for.

This appears to be a rate limiting feature that Mojo has implemented, likely for system performance and security reasons. From the ticket, it seems this was an unusual occurrence for a long-time client. Here's what I'd recommend: 1. **Wait for the 15-minute period to expire** - The system should automatically restore access after this timeframe 2. **Contact Mojo Support directly** if this continues to be an issue - Based on the ticket history, they were able to resolve similar printing issues and can investigate if this is a system-wide limitation or account-specific issue 3. **Consider your printing volume** - If you're doing large batch printing operations, you might want to break them into smaller chunks to avoid triggering rate limits The support team resolved a similar printing contact issue mentioned in another ticket, so they should be able to help clarify whether this is a permanent limitation or a temporary system protection measure. If you need immediate assistance with this issue, I'd recommend reaching out to Mojo Support directly since they can review your specific account settings and usage patterns.",3,2,
