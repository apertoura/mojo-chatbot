    "content": "The Mojo mobile app, called 'Mojo on the Go,' brings the power of Mojo Dialer to your iOS or Android device, allowing you to prospect from anywhere.\n\nDownloading the App:\n\niOS:\n- Open App Store\n- Search for 'Mojo Selling'\n- Tap 'Get' to download\n- Install and open\n\nAndroid:\n- Open Google Play Store\n- Search for 'Mojo Selling'\n- Tap 'Install'\n- Open after installation\n\nInitial Setup:\n\n1. Login\n- Enter your Mojo username and email\n- Enter your password\n- Tap 'Sign In'\n\n2. Permissions\n- Allow phone permissions (required for calling)\n- Allow contacts access (optional but recommended)\n- Allow notifications (to receive alerts)\n- Allow microphone access (required for calls)\n\n3. Caller ID Whitelist (IMPORTANT)\nThe mobile app uses AWS Chime for dialing through Mojo servers. To prevent unknown numbers:\n\n- Mojo will display a list of dialer server phone numbers\n- Add these numbers to your phone's contacts\n- Name them \"Mojo Dialer 1\", \"Mojo Dialer 2\", etc.\n- This ensures when the app calls you back, it shows \"Mojo Dialer\" instead of unknown\n\nTypically 5-10 numbers need to be whitelisted depending on your server allocation.\n\nMobile App Features:\n\n1. Power Dialing\n- Access your call lists\n- Single-line and click-to-call modes\n- (Note: Triple-line dialing not available on mobile)\n- Log call results on the go\n- Add notes immediately after calls\n\n2. Contact Management\n- View full contact database\n- Search and filter contacts\n- View contact details and history\n- Edit contact information\n- Add new contacts manually\n- Mark contacts as DNC\n\n3.

Lists and Filters\n- Access all your call lists\n- Apply saved filters\n- Create new lists\n- Organize contacts\n\nHow Mobile Dialing Works:\n\n1. The Mojo app uses AWS Chime technology\n2. When you click to call, the app connects to Mojo servers\n3. The server calls the contact\n4. The server calls your mobile phone\n5. When both answer, the calls are bridged\n6. You're connected through Mojo's system\n\nBenefits:\n- Your personal number stays private (caller ID shows Mojo number)\n- Calls are recorded in Mojo\n- Works over cellular or WiFi\n- Better call quality than direct mobile calls\n- Integrated with Mojo features\n\nMobile vs Web:\n\nAvailable on Mobile:\n✓ Click-to-call and single-line dialing\n✓ Contact management\n✓ Email and SMS\n✓ Calendar and tasks\n✓ Call logging\n✓ Notes and history\n\nWeb/Desktop Only:\n✗ Triple-line power dialing\n✗ Advanced reporting\n✗ Bulk operations\n✗ Admin functions\n✗ Integrations setup\n\nTips for Mobile Usage:\n\n1. Stable Connection\n- Use WiFi when possible for best quality\n- If using cellular, ensure strong signal (4 bars)\n- 4G/5G recommended over 3G\n\n2. Battery Management\n- Close other apps to save battery\n- Bring a portable charger for long sessions\n- Lower screen brightness\n- Enable low power mode if battery is low\n\n3. Environment\n- Use headphones for better audio\n- Find quiet location for professional calls\n- Avoid driving while using the dialer (safety first!)\n\n4. Data Usage\n- Mobile dialing uses approximately 1-2 MB per minute\n- WiFi recommended to avoid cellular data charges\n- Check your data plan if using mobile data extensively\n\nTroubleshooting Mobile Issues:\n\n1. Can't Login\n- Verify username and password are correct\n- Check internet connection\n- Update app to latest version\n- Restart phone and try again\n\n2. No Audio\n- Check microphone permissions: Phone Settings > Mojo > Microphone\n- Verify volume is turned up\n- Try with and without headphones\n- Check that phone is not on mute/silent\n\n3. Unknown Numbers Appearing\n- You forgot to whitelist dialer server numbers\n- Go to Mojo settings in app\n- View server numbers\n- Add them to your contacts\n\n4. App Crashes\n- Update to latest version\n- Restart phone\n- Clear app cache: Phone Settings > Mojo > Storage > Clear Cache\n- Uninstall and reinstall if problems persist\n\n5. Poor Call Quality\n- Check internet connection speed\n- Switch from WiFi to cellular or vice versa\n- Move closer to WiFi router\n- Close background apps\n- Restart the app\n\nUpdating the App:\n\niOS:\n- Open App Store\n- Tap your profile icon\n- Scroll to find Mojo Selling\n- Tap 'Update' if available\n\nAndroid:\n- Open Google Play Store\n- Tap menu > My apps & games\n- Find Mojo Selling\n- Tap 'Update' if available\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. Use mobile for:\n- Callbacks while away from desk\n- Following up between appointments\n- Quick contact updates\n- Checking calendar and tasks\n\n2. Use desktop/web for:\n- High-volume power dialing sessions\n- Data imports and list management\n- Detailed reporting and analytics\n- Admin and setup tasks\n\nThe mobile app is perfect for agents who are frequently on the go but still want to maintain consistent prospecting activity. It's a complement to the web platform, not a replacement.",
