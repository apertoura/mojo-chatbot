    "content": "How to import data into Mojo How to Import Spreadsheets of Leads and Contacts into Mojo Dialer Introduction Importing your leads and contacts into the Mojo dialer is a straightforward process that allows you to efficiently organize and manage your customer data. This guide will walk you through the complete import process, from selecting your file to finalizing your import. Whether you're importing a new list or adding to an existing one, this step-by-step tutorial will help you get started quickly. Refer to the How-To videos on each step for guidance. Step 1: Choose Your File Click the Choose File button. Locate the spreadsheet file you want to import on your computer. Select the file and click Open. Mojo accepts XLS, XLSX, and CSV file formats. Once your file is selected, click Next to proceed to step two. Step 2: Select Import Destination In this step, you'll decide where to place your imported contacts: Choose whether to import into a Calling List or a Group: Calling Lists are general collections of leads to call or perform mass actions on that you have not yet spoken to. Groups are for leads with specific qualifications (hot leads, warm leads, future follow-ups, past clients, etc.) that you have spoken to. You can either: Create a new list/group by clicking the plus sign in the top right corner, then clicking Save. Add to an existing list/group by clicking on it in the displayed options. Optional settings: Manager selection (only needed if you have multiple agents with limited access). Source field to identify where your data came from (can select existing sources or create a new one). Click Next to continue to step three. Step 3: Map Your Fields This step connects your spreadsheet columns to the appropriate fields in Mojo: If you've imported similar spreadsheets before, you can select a saved Import Template from the dropdown on the left side. *They must have the same file field/header assignments. Mojo offers Smart Mapping, which automatically matches recognized fields from your spreadsheet. For manual mapping: Match each column from your spreadsheet to the corresponding Mojo field using the dropdowns. For example, map your spreadsheet's \"Full Name\" column to Mojo's \"Full Name\" field. If you have separate first and last name columns, map them individually to their respective fields. Address mapping: Map fields like Address, City, State, and Zip Code to their respective Mojo fields. If a field is incorrectly matched, click the X next to it to remove the mapping. Use the dropdown to select the correct field if needed.Refer to the Spreadsheet Reference at the bottom as needed. This shows the first few lines from your file so that you can identify the type of data in each column and refer to this when assigning your file fields. Phone number mapping: Mojo supports stacking fields for multiple phone numbers. Map each phone number field from your spreadsheet to the appropriate field in Mojo. Additional phone fields will appear automatically as you add them. Email mapping: Map the email field from your spreadsheet to the email field in Mojo. Miscellaneous information: For additional data beyond basic contact information, use the miscellaneous fields. Create custom fields by clicking the plus sign if needed. Select the appropriate field type (text, date, time, number, decimal, or percentage). Save your mapping as a template for future imports by clicking the save option. Click Next to proceed to step four. Step 4: Check for Duplicates This optional step helps you manage duplicate records: Choose where to check for duplicates: In the entire database (all lists and groups) Within the file you're importing Both options Select how to identify duplicates: By phone number (most common) By email By property address By mailing address Decide how to handle duplicates: Keep Old (default): Existing records are kept, and duplicates are not imported. Keep New: New records will replace existing records (note: this will delete any existing notes or call history). Import New and Old: Import duplicates, creating separate records (useful for having the same contact on multiple lists). Click Next to advance to the final step. Step 5: Review and Complete Import In this final step, you'll review all your import settings before finalizing: Review the summary information: The destination list or group Source assignment Field mapping summaryNumber of Phones on your Mojo DNC List Number of duplicates found (if checked) Make adjustments if needed: Click Back to return to previous steps Select Remap Data to go directly to the field mapping step View duplicate records by clicking Show in the duplicates section.View phone numbers flagged as DNC by clicking Show the Phones in the DNC section When everything looks correct, click Finish Import to complete the process. Conclusion By following these five steps, you can efficiently import your leads and contacts into the Mojo dialer system. This organized approach will help you maintain clean data while setting up your contact lists for successful calling campaigns. Remember that proper field mapping and duplicate management are key to maintaining high-quality contact data in your Mojo account.

    "content": "Fixing Call Delays and Dead Air Pickups Understanding and Optimizing Call Performance with Mojo DialerMojo Dialer delivers exceptional call quality through its direct connection to a Tier 1 carrier switch, outperforming standard VoIP systems. However, certain factors on your end may introduce delays or dead air during calls. Here's how to identify and resolve these issues.Common Causes of Call Delays1. WiFi Calling on Mobile PhonesWiFi calling adds noticeable latency during rapid dialing sessions, even when imperceptible during standard calls. Solution: Disable WiFi calling in your phone settings Use a strong, stable cellular connection instead 2. LTE/VoLTE CallingLike WiFi calling, LTE/VoLTE uses data for voice transmission, which can compromise call quality during high-speed dialing. Solution: Check if your carrier allows disabling VoLTE in phone settings Use traditional cellular calling when possible 3. VoIP Phone Quality IssuesVoIP service quality varies significantly, with budget providers often experiencing inconsistent performance. Solution: Choose a premium VoIP provider known for low latencyChoose a service that is for \"business-use\" rather than \"personal-use\" Use wired internet connections rather than WiFi Avoid budget softphone solutions for Mojo dialing Request \"Voice Priority\" configuration from your network administrator or phone service provider Note for International Users: Geographic distance may introduce additional latency. Prioritize connection stability for best results. 4. Live Answer Beep SettingThis feature signals live answers but introduces a short delay before audio transmission begins. Solution: Disable Live Answer Beep in Mojo settings if immediate audio is critical Consider the tradeoff between notification benefits and conversation immediacy Quick Optimization Checklist Turn off WiFi calling on mobile devices Disable VoLTE if possible Use a quality VoIP provider or direct cellular connection Consider disabling Live Answer Beep for faster engagement If issues persist after making these adjustments, contact our support team for further assistance.

It is important to decide the synchronization option for each stage:Not Sync: Chosen stages won’t be synchronized.One-way (FUB → Mojo): Leads in this stage from FUB will synchronize into Mojo.Two-way (Mojo ↔ FUB): Any changes in either FUB or Mojo will reflect on both platforms.Correctly syncing these stages helps ensure the necessary data travels between your FUB and Mojo accounts smoothly.Managing Smart ListsManaging Smart Lists involves selecting the lists you wish to sync with Mojo. It is important to remember that:Smart Lists must contain fewer than 2,000 contacts due to FUB restrictions. Lists larger than this will not sync.Any desirable Smart List must be initially configured in FUB and cannot be edited within Mojo.Once synced, it allows dialing directly from Mojo and categorized groups corresponding to your Stages or Smart Lists.Important ConsiderationsWhen working with this integration, consider that FUB transmits data to Mojo at a rate of 1,000 leads per hour. To avoid overloading the system, it's advisable to sync data in manageable, smaller batches. This pacing helps ensure that all updates are processed smoothly and efficiently.Additionally, while you may manage which contacts are part of your Smart Lists from within FUB, Mojo provides the functionality to make calls directly after these lists are synced and arranged. Individual contacts from Mojo can also be sent back into FUB by assigning them to a particular Stage Group.Troubleshooting Email Changes and Integration UpdatesIf changes to your email or user information are required:Log into your FUB account using your most recent email.Navigate to the Account section.Click Edit Information to modify your email, ensuring it aligns with your current user requirements.After updating, use the new email credentials for future logins.By maintaining updated login information, you ensure continuity in accessing both Mojo and FUB and that integration updates proceed unobstructed.ConclusionEfficiently managing Follow Up Boss and Mojo integration requires precise setup of API Key usage, Stage and Smart List synchronization, and accommodating potential FUB limitations. By following the outlined steps and monitoring data transfer rates, users can seamlessly manage leads across both applications, ensuring enhanced productivity and follow-up efficiency.For any additional support or personalization of your integration settings, it is recommended to consult with the respective platform's customer service team, who may provide customized assistance tailored to your specific needs.

These violations jeopardize our entire lead delivery platform, risking termination by our partners who have specific acceptable use cases. These narrow use cases enable us to acquire high-quality data at a discount, benefiting our customers. Specifically, Mojo Neighborhood Search and Skip Tracer data fall within this limited scope.To address this issue, we will take the following steps:Review and strengthen our terms of service to clearly outline acceptable use cases and the consequences of non-compliance.Communicate with the clients who breached the terms, reminding them of the agreed-upon use cases and emphasizing the importance of adherence.Enhance monitoring and auditing procedures to identify any unauthorized data usage.Implement measures to prevent unauthorized transfers of Neighborhood Search and Skip Tracer data, such as blocking middleware programs and limiting exporting from the Mojo system.Work with our providers to enable controlled exporting for typical use cases, allowing data transfer through middleware and direct integration.We expect to have an agreement in place near future which will allow us to send Neighborhood Search and Skip tracer data via middleware and direct integrations using a modified approach more inline with our clients needs.

    "content": "How to Find Past Called Contacts Easily How to Retrieve and Review Your Call LogIn sales and customer contact environments, recording accurate notes about your interactions is vital for follow-up and maintaining good relationships. Sometimes, issues like unsaved notes or accidentally closed windows can disrupt this process. This guide helps you access call logs and retrieve information from calls you may have recently made or lost. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to find your needed contact logs efficiently.Accessing Call Logs via Call Detail ReportIf you find yourself in a situation where your notes were unsaved or a call window was prematurely closed, you can still locate the contact through the Call Detail Report. This tool provides comprehensive information about each call made, including the name of the contact and the time of the call. Here’s how to navigate the Call Detail Report:Step-by-Step Process Generating the Call Detail Report Begin by accessing the Reports section in Mojo. From there, generate the Call Detail Report for the specific date range or interval during which the call took place. This report will list all outgoing calls within the specified parameters. Sorting and Searching the Call Log Upon opening the report, the most recent calls will appear at the top of the list by default. If you remember the name of the contact, you can quickly scan through the top entries. Alternatively, use the Search function to type “Contact” in the search bar. This action will filter the results to show all interactions, categorized under Contact, No Contact, and Do Not Contact. For efficiency, sort the results to display all \"Contact\" entries at the top. This should help to quickly pinpoint the interaction you need to review. Reviewing and Managing Contacts Once you identify the desired contact, double-click on the name. This action opens up the contact form, allowing you to review any existing data and manage the lead effectively. You can also add additional notes if necessary, ensuring that all pertinent information is documented. Tips for Effective UseAlways ensure that notes are posted accurately after completing the interaction with a lead before proceeding with further calls.Regularly backing up your call records or exporting reports can be a good practice to prevent data loss in volatile environments.Final InsightsHandling unsaved notes and retrieving contact logs doesn’t have to be a cumbersome task. By utilizing tools like the Call Detail Report, you can regain access to potentially lost interactions and ensure your follow-up processes remain intact. Leveraging these tools effectively will help you maintain a comprehensive record of your sales activities and enhance customer interaction efficiency.Remember, keeping organized and familiarizing yourself with the report functionalities can significantly streamline your workflow.

This article will help you identify and resolve them quickly. Common Causes: 1. Large quantities of data in groups or lists being loaded. Folders containing thousands of leads take longer to load, especially if there are notes, multiple group assignments or activity logs. 2. Mojo is cloud based. A slow or inconsistent connection will cause lag when loading lists and groups. 3. Browser Outdated. Make sure your browser is fully updated to the most current version. Mojo is constantly optimized for the latest browser configurations. Ideally, use Google Chrome ot access Mojo with minimal extensions or add-ons.4. Cached Data. Not closing and reopening Mojo can create issues with aged cached data. Old or corrupted cache/cookies will cause slow load times. 5. Mojo server load. In rare cases, Mojo may have an event on the server you are connected to which creates a lag. These are temporary and do not persist. If you feel this is the reason for your latency, and you've ruled out the issues above, please call us at 877-859-6656.

Understanding Internet Quality Impact on Mojo PerformanceThis guide helps you identify how internet connection quality affects your Mojo experience and what to expect under various conditions.Important Notes This guide covers common internet-related issues but may not address all potential problems within office networks The behaviors described below do not cover VoIP phone-specific issues (see VoIP section at the end) Key fact: If using a cell phone (with WIFI calling features turned off) or hardline phone, your call will NOT drop if you lose internet connection. Your internet only impacts data transmission in Mojo Quality MeterLocated at the bottom left of your Mojo interface, the quality meter provides real-time feedback (with less than 5-second latency) on your internet connection strength.While the meter considers connection speed, it primarily reflects signal quality measured by ping time in milliseconds: IIII (0-250ms) - Very solid connection No latency when navigating through Mojo or power dialing III (251-500ms) - Good connection Slight delay when navigating through contact records Power dialing performs normally with minimal impact II (501-750ms) - Poor connection Noticeable delays while navigating Mojo Contact-to-contact and data navigation becomes slow and jerky Reduced call volume capacity Dialing boxes may appear out of sync Lines may spend extra time in \"free\" and \"preparing\" states I (751-1000+ms) - Very poor connection Severe delays navigating through Mojo Extremely slow dialing Lines often stuck in \"free\" or \"preparing\" status Latency beyond 1500ms may begin dropping your signal to Mojo, triggering the \"loss of internet\" pop-up Connection Loss Pop-UpsMojo continuously monitors for complete internet connection loss while both navigating and dialing. When a loss is detected, you'll receive a notification pop-up. Note: These messages only appear when the connection issue is on the user's end. Technical support cannot troubleshoot internet-related issues, including network, firewall, router, VPN and anti-virus problems. Using VoIP Phones with MojoWhile thousands of users successfully connect to Mojo with VoIP solutions, be aware of these challenges: VoIP phones consume available bandwidth, reducing data transmission capacity Connection problems typically manifest first in your VoIP connection: Delayed \"hello\" connections Call drops Distorted \"robot voice\" audio Conversation issues like talking over each other Helpful tip: Request that your internet provider enable \"voice priority\" to prioritize voice connections over data during minor internet issues.Common VoIP Phone Services Skype Vonage Magic Jack SIP desktop phones Comcast Cable Business Phone System And many others If unsure whether you're using VoIP, check for an ethernet cord or phone line connection on your phone. You can also search for your phone's model number online. For additional questions, please contact our technical support team.

    "content": "How to Import Data Files in to Mojo &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: Here’s the text formatted with proper sentence structure and consistent flow, without changing any of the content: Hello and welcome to the first step of importing your spreadsheet. In this step, we're going to choose the file that you would like to import. First, I'll click Choose File, find the file that I'd like to import, and then click Open. Mojo accepts XLS, XLSX, and CSV files. Once I have my file selected, I can click Next to go to the next step. In Step Two of the import process, you'll choose where you want the spreadsheet to be imported. You can either import it into a calling list or a group. You can create a new calling list by clicking the plus sign on the top right corner and hitting Save. Or you can create a group. Groups are designated for leads that already have a qualification — they might be a hot lead, a warm lead, or a future follow-up. You might even create a group for your past clients or sphere of influence. You can also add to an existing list or group simply by clicking on the list or group that you'd like to add the spreadsheet to. You can also select a manager. The manager is optional — it's really only used if you have multiple agents under the account, and they are lower-accessed and you want them to have access to those leads that might be in specific groups. Otherwise, a manager is not needed. The source is where your data may have come from, and it's a good way for extra identification, but it is optional as well. You don't have to create one. You can either choose from some of your existing sources or create a new source. Once I have all my selections in step two, I'm going to click Next to move on to the next step. In Step Three of the import process, you'll be mapping your fields. Mapping your fields is simply matching up the fields from your spreadsheet to the spots that we have designated in Mojo. If you've imported a spreadsheet before or you would like to save what's called an import template, you would look over here on the left. An import template is just saving your mapping, so it will save you some time in the long run. Now, in Mojo, we do offer what's called Smart Mapping. If we recognize the fields that are on your spreadsheet, we will automatically match them up for you without you having to do anything extra. If you need a little extra help along the way, we do offer some instructional text here on the left. You'll see information for the import template and your spreadsheet reference — if we scroll all the way down to the bottom, we see a preview of your spreadsheet itself, so that way you're not just guessing what your spreadsheet looks like. We also discuss things like stacking fields and your miscellaneous fields. When you're mapping your fields, as mentioned before, you're just going to be matching up the fields from your spreadsheet to Mojo. You'll see Full Name automatically matched to the First or Full Name spot. If I have two separate names — a first name and a last name — then I would want to match the last name. If you have a co-owner, you would match the co-owner there. It looks like my Address already matched up, but my City did not. If I click the dropdown box, I can find Site City that matches with Property City. If I'm not sure, I can scroll down and take a look at the spreadsheet reference. If I find that there's a field out there that is matched that shouldn't be, I can click the X, and that will delete that mapped field. We have all the standard fields for Address, City, State, and Zip Code, including Mailing Address, Mailing City, and Mailing Zip. We automatically matched up three phone numbers here — Primary Phone, Phone 1, and Phone 3. If that wasn't all of the phones, I can match another one. I'll put Direct Phone there. When I added the phone number field, another phone number field showed up below that, so you'll be stacking your fields. If you have any phone fields on your spreadsheet that are specifically for Cell Phone or Mobile Phone, you would match them into the Mobile Phone field. Email goes to Email. Then we move down to the Miscellaneous Fields or Information Fields. These fields are for any additional pieces of information that might be on the spreadsheet outside of the basic contact information. If you're in real estate, you may have information like Listing Status or Status Change Date. If we don't have a field that's already created for you, we give you the ability to custom-create your own miscellaneous or information field just by clicking the plus sign. From here, you can name it and then choose the type — whether it's Text, Date, Time, Number, Decimal Number, or Percentage. I'll just choose Text for now. Now, if I had everything matched up that I wanted to and I knew I'd be importing from the same source over and over again, I would choose to save a template. Next time I come in, I would just have to click on the dropdown and choose my import template. Once I have everything matched up that I'd like, I'd click Next to go on to the next step. In Step Four of the import process, you will check for duplicates. Checking for duplicates is optional — you don't have to do that. We give you the option to check for duplicates against the entire database — meaning all lists and groups in your Mojo — or the file itself. The most common option for checking duplicates would be by the Phone Number, but we also give you the option to choose Email, Property Address, or Mailing Address. Then you’ll decide how you want to handle duplicates in the database: Keep Old – If the record already exists in your Mojo, we would not bring it in a second time. Keep New – This will overwrite and replace existing records in your Mojo with the new ones you're importing (which means you would lose any notes or call history). Import New and Old – This allows you to import duplicates so the same person can exist on multiple lists with different call histories and notes. As you change each option, the description will change so you can be reminded of what each option does. Once you've selected your duplicate options, you'll click Next to go on to Step Five. In Step Five — the final step of importing your spreadsheet — you can review everything that you've previously done. This includes: What list you're about to import into What source you’re using What fields you're about to import Duplicate information (how many duplicates were in the database and on the spreadsheet) If you want to go back and change any of your settings, you can click Back to return to the previous step. You can also fast-track back to the mapping step by clicking Remap Data. If you want to see the duplicates in your database, you can scroll down after clicking Show. The same applies to duplicates on the spreadsheet — you can view them directly. Once you've ensured everything is selected properly and all the fields you want to be imported are ready, click Finish Import.

    "content": "How To Set Up Action Plans &lt;br&gt;Video Transcription: Hello, In this video, I'm going to discuss action plans. I'm going to discuss what action plans are in Mojo, how to create them, and how to assign them to your leads. The first step would be getting into the settings section of your Mojo so you can create or access your existing action plans. To get to settings, you would click the menu on the bottom left, choose settings, and then from settings, you would choose action plans. An action plan is a preset follow-up sales process. What that means is instead of having to schedule a follow-up call manually every few days or remember to send an email every other day or to print off a letter every fifth day, you can set up an action plan that automatically schedules those types of follow-up actions. It's a one-click to assign, and everything gets scheduled out for you, helping ensure that no one's going to fall through the cracks. An action plan in Mojo can include follow-up calls, drip emails, printing of letters and labels, and tasks. You can create your own action plan or you can actually grab some pre-built ones that we offer in Mojo as well. When I choose pre-built action plans, you'll see we have a list of action plans. I've already imported some of them, so you'll see \"already in use\" for the ones I've grabbed. I can grab a new one if I want to and then choose to import it. Now I have the 8x8 action plan that was pre-built in Mojo. Anyone who has Mojo has access to these action plans. To create a brand new action plan, you would do so just by clicking the create button. Once you click on create, the first step is to enter a name. The next step would be choosing your scheduling type: frequency-based or date-based. Frequency-based means you're scheduling an activity based on specific days. For example, you may have a call that needs to take place on day one, then an email that goes out on day three, and a letter that goes out on day five. The date-based option is specific to the date on the calendar itself. For example, if you wanted the calls to happen on the 18th of the month or a letter to go out on the first of the month, that would be date-based scheduling. Next, you have to choose your scheduling logic. We have non-strict order and strict order. Non-strict order means that all of the activities that you have on your action plan will be available and scheduled throughout the entire course of the action plan. Strict order means that you have to complete the previous step before the next step is scheduled. On the bottom is the weekend option. In some cases, you don't want to have anything scheduled on weekends, whether it's an automated drip email or a phone call. If that's the case, you can choose whether you want your steps to be scheduled on the weekends. Now I'm going to go to the next step. In this step, we’re going to set up the different action plan steps. We start off on step one. From here, I can choose which type of action step I want. If I want an email, I would choose email. If I had multiple agents under the account and I wanted a specific agent to take care of this action plan step, I would choose that agent. Then I would choose the email template, which is one that I would have either created myself or pulled from one of the pre-built templates that we offer in Mojo. You can access the email templates or create your own by going to email on the left side in settings. Next, it asks me to choose which day I want to begin on. In this case, it says day zero. The way we have it set up, zero would mean today. If I assigned someone to the action plan today, this step would take place today on day zero. I can add additional steps. For example, I can add a phone call, choose a script for that call, and set it to take place on day three. I can add a mailing label and set it to take place on day six. I can add a task, which could be a simple reminder. I can also add a letter, choosing from either pre-built letters or ones I’ve created myself. I can add as many steps as I want and adjust the frequency as needed. Next, we have the trigger step. You can set it up so that your action plan is automatically assigned to leads based on a specific trigger. For example, if you wanted this plan to be assigned to expired properties, you would check off \"property listing status,\" select \"expired,\" and anyone with a listing status of expired in your properties list would automatically get assigned this action plan. You can also set triggers based on adding someone to a calling list or a group. Depending on how you want that trigger logic to work, you can choose to have the contact removed from the action plan if they are removed from that specific group, calling list, or listing status. In the video example today, I'm not going to choose any triggers, but we give you that option if you’d like. Click next to get to the last step, which is choosing your end logic. The end logic determines what happens when the action plan is finished. You could choose to do nothing, which means the action plan just finishes and that’s it. You could choose to repeat the action plan and schedule it to start again after a certain period. You could roll into another action plan and start a whole new process automatically. You can also choose to have all the records in the action plan, once they've reached the end, automatically assigned to a group of your choosing. Once you save the action plan, you’ll see it in the list of action plans. You can see the status, the type of scheduling, and the order type. You can click the edit button to change the details or view the list of contacts assigned to the action plan. If I select the expired property action plan, for example, I can see that I have five contacts currently in that plan. I can choose to edit the steps or delete the action plan if needed. If you want to assign an action plan to a record, you can do it from the data and dialer screen. Go to data and dialer, open a list (such as the Mojo Training List), select the records you want to assign, and choose \"assign to action plan.\" You can choose the specific plan and set the start date. You can also assign action plans directly from the contact itself. If you open a contact record, you’ll see the action plan section at the top. From here, you can stop, change, reassign, or skip a step in the plan. You can even add an additional action plan if needed. Once an action plan is assigned, follow-ups will appear in the calendar section of Mojo. If you have any follow-up calls scheduled, they will show up in the future or the past if they were missed. You can also print out letters or labels directly from the calendar. This allows you to complete all of those activities efficiently. Instead of having to manually schedule follow-up calls, emails, and other steps, Mojo automates the process for you. This ensures that no one falls through the cracks and that your follow-up is consistent and strategic. That was an overview of action plans and how to create and use them in Mojo. If you have any questions or need more detailed guidance, reach out to our support team — we're always here to help. Thank you so much, and I hope you make it a great day!

    "content": "Mojo Prospecting Dashboard Overview &lt;br&gt;Video Transcription: Hello, In this video, I'm going to show you all about the Personal Dashboard, or Prospecting Dashboard, that we offer in Mojo. This is a fantastic feature that allows you to keep track of your prospecting goals and KPIs so you can be as efficient as possible when doing your prospecting. To access your Personal Dashboard, it's very easy. You go to the top right of your Mojo and you'll see an icon that looks like a phone with a little lightning bolt coming out of it. When you hover over it, it will say Personal Dashboard. When I click on that, it's going to take me to a whole new site. This site allows me to see a breakdown of all my different statistics and KPIs. If we look on the left, it keeps track of things like your dialing time, calls, contacts, leads, and the appointments that you set. We also get to see a graphic here showing progress toward your goal. You can set specific goals for yourself, and it breaks down your calls per hour, contacts per hour, calls per contact, contact rate, and prospecting time per lead. We do all of the math for you so you can really see where your time is going when doing your prospecting. Now, you're not going to start off with a goal right away—you'd have to set that. If I choose Edit, this is the screen that you would see when you're setting up your goal. You can choose your dialing time—how much dialing time you want for your goal to be. For example, maybe I want it to be 5 hours and 30 minutes or maybe 25 hours. You can choose which goal you want to see while you're making calls, and it’ll keep you up to date with how close you are to reaching your goal. You can set your goal for a week, a month, or even a custom date range if you'd like. Once you hit Submit, it takes you back to this screen where it's going to show you where you're at with your goal. Team Leaderboard Beyond the Personal Dashboard, we have some other features as well, such as the Team Leaderboard. If you have multiple logins or multiple agents under your account, you can have a leaderboard and be able to track all of this right from this section. If you're the owner or manager of an account, you can leave this up and track the progress and KPIs of all of the agents under your account. It will show you who is in the lead based on the top stats, including total contacts and calls. It breaks everything down very nicely and neatly. If I click on an individual agent, it will show me their individual statistics. Leagues We also offer Leagues. Leagues allow you to compare and compete against other members of Mojo outside of your account. You can start your own league and make it public so that anybody can join, or you can have it private, so it's invite-only. It's a great way to build a network of other Mojo subscribers who also want to make sure their prospecting time is used in the most efficient way possible. Total Revenue Tracking We've included a Total Revenue option as well. Within Total Revenue, you can see how much revenue you've generated, what your start date is versus your end date, and other key metrics. For example, if I select a later date range, it will show me how much total dialing time I've had, how many calls I've made, and how many appointments I've set. It does all the math for you, breaking everything down clearly. Historical Data We also include Historical Data. Historical Data lets you see how many calls you've made, how much dialing time you've logged, and your average calls and contacts over a longer period of time. You can see it all in a nice graph. For example, if I want to look at all of my agents, it will show all of them. Or if I want to just see my own data, I can filter it that way. It's definitely a very powerful tool. Manual Progress Now, not all prospecting happens within Mojo. There might be times when you take an inbound call from someone or just call somebody back. If you want to count that as a contact or include that time in your dialing stats, you can choose Add Progress. This allows you to manually add progress to your Prospecting Dashboard. This feature helps you stay efficient and aware of where you're making your money and spending your time. Display on Big Screens This feature isn’t limited to just the computer. We've had many accounts and teams put it on a big screen TV in their office so that the whole team can keep an eye on the leaderboard and see who’s leading in calls, contacts, and leads. Leads and Appointments Finally, let's discuss what counts as leads and appointments. Leads – Within Mojo, you can designate groups as lead groups, which means that as you add people to that group, it will count as a lead in your Mojo. Appointments – These are specifically for appointments that are scheduled on your Mojo calendar. Contacts – These are counted when you mark someone as a contact within Mojo. Again, you can always manually add progress if needed. This was a video about the Prospecting or Personal Dashboard within Mojo—a powerful tool included in your subscription. Take advantage of it as much as you possibly can.

    "content": "How To Create Email Templates &lt;br&gt;Video Transcription: Hello, In this video, I'm going to show you how to set up an email template. The first step will be going to settings. To get to settings, click the menu button on the bottom left and then choose settings. From settings, select email, which will take you to the template section. From the template section, you can either choose a pre-built template or start a new template. I'm going to start a new template. From here, I can either start from scratch or use one of the pre-existing layouts, which I can then alter and put in my own information. I'm going to start with the \"Start from Scratch\" option. Once I choose \"Start from Scratch,\" the first part I need to enter is the label. The label is for your own internal reference, so it's important to label it something that's easy to identify so you don't have to open each template to find out what the content is. For today, I'm going to call it \"My Demo Template.\" The subject is what people will see when you send them the email. You can choose to add attachments if you want, and you can also include subject tags. Tags within Mojo will automatically populate information from that record into your email. For example, if you want to include the person's first name, last name, or address, you can include that information using tags. You can also choose to CC or BCC with the email template. We start you off with a text block that says, \"I'm a new text block ready for your content.\" You can delete that and start typing your content. As soon as you start typing, a toolbar will appear. If you want to include a merge tag, you would type something like \"Dear [First Name]\" and then begin writing the body. You can use the toolbar to adjust the size and type of font, bold or italicize text, align content, and more. This works well for basic emails, but you may want to include additional structure. On the right side, there's a content section where you can add more elements to your email. For example, you can add an image by dragging the image block over to the template, dropping it into place, and browsing to upload an image. You can also include buttons, dividers, social media links, dynamic content (like your email signature), HTML blocks, video links, icons, and additional text. Under the \"Rows\" tab, you can adjust the layout of your email. If you accidentally place content in the wrong section, you can delete it by clicking the trash can icon. This allows you to customize the structure of your email to suit your needs. In the \"Settings\" tab, you can adjust details like the content area width, content area alignment, and background color. This is an advanced email template creator, so it may take a little bit of time to get used to, but it's very powerful and gives you a lot of options. One feature we offer is the ability to improve your text with AI. Instead of thinking of all the content yourself, you can have AI create it for you. For example, if I want to write an email about Thanksgiving, I can ask AI to generate the content. I can adjust the tone to make it more formal, add humor, or shorten the text. Once I’m happy with it, I hit the save button and it automatically inserts the text into my template. You may want to see how your email will look before sending it. You can choose \"Send Test Email\" to send a test version to yourself, or you can select \"Preview.\" The preview option allows you to see how the email will look on both desktop and mobile devices, which is important since many people check their emails on their phones. We give you a lot of options for creating email templates, but the best advice we can give is to keep your emails simple. The more complex and cluttered your email is, the more likely it is to end up in a spam folder. Avoid using too many buzzwords and try to keep your messaging clear and straightforward. I'm going to save this template, and it will now show up in the settings section. This has been a video about creating an email template. Thanks so much, and I hope you're making it a great day!

    "content": "How To Use The Mojo Calendar &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: Hello everyone, in this video, I'm going to talk about the Mojo Calendar section. The Calendar section is where all of your activities, such as follow-up calls, tasks, appointments, printing out letters and labels, birthdays, and even home close date reminders, will show up. It's a very powerful tool that keeps you organized. As you can see here on the calendar, it shows all of my activities: appointments, tasks, follow-up calls, letters, labels, birthdays, home close dates, and I can even track my completed activities. I have the ability to look at just today, the past, or the future. These controls up here allow me to choose how I want to view my calendar. Right now, I'm in a list view, but if I clicked on that, it would show me more of a calendar view. All of my activities are displayed in the bottom section. You can choose to complete them or delete them by clicking the three dots on the far right. You can also quickly go to a different calendar date. We also have some mass actions you can perform. For example, you can select just your follow-up calls, mark them complete, assign them to a different person, print them, do a mass reschedule, or even export them. If you have follow-up calls that don’t have a specific time associated with them, you can easily dial them just by clicking the \"Dial Follow-Up Calls\" button. When you click that, it takes you to the Calendar Call Wizard, which allows you to start a dial session. You can do a power dial session or a click-to-call session on those follow-up calls. We can see all the different tasks broken down. Whether it was just a follow-up call or an appointment, it’s also where action plan activities will show up. Action plans are predefined sales pipeline processes, allowing you to assign someone to an action plan. It will automatically schedule follow-up calls or printing of mailing letters or labels. It's definitely a powerful tool and keeps you very organized right here in the calendar. We give you the ability to search for your contacts in here, and you can choose a specific date range if you're looking for them. This is again where you'll be able to see any follow-up call, task, or appointment that you have scheduled. If I open up one of the contacts, you’ll see the regular contact screen. To schedule an appointment, task, or follow-up call, simply click on one of the options at the top. If you have action plans, you'll be able to assign someone to the action plan. It will show you if they're already in an action plan, and again, it will schedule those activities on the calendar. This was just a quick video about how you can use the Mojo Calendar. Again, we have live training sessions twice a day at 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern, Monday through Friday. Our support team is always standing by to help you out.

    "content": "Navigating The Data and Dialer &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: Hello everyone, in this video, I'm going to talk about the Data and Dialer screen. The Data and Dialer screen is where you're going to spend most of your time when using Mojo. Aside from making calls, this is where you'll see all of your lists, organize your data, perform mass actions, and stay in touch with the data you have in your Mojo account. We break everything down into different categories: All Contacts: This shows you all of the contacts in your entire database. Properties: Here, you can choose whether you want to select an expired list, a cancelled list, or a withdrawn list. This is where any data with a listing status will go. For example, if you subscribe to Mojo’s expired data, you would see that data posted into the property section under the expired calling list. Calling Lists: This is where any of your data will go that you import as a spreadsheet, or if you have a vendor that posts data directly to your Mojo account as a calling list. If you're subscribed to the Neighborhood Search and bring in a list, it will also appear here. Groups: This is where all of your data will go once you've qualified it. For example, once you've spoken to someone and qualify them as a hot lead, warm lead, or maybe not a great lead, you can classify them under trash or not yet interested. When you select a list, it will turn green. This indicates that you’ve selected that list, group, or property list. The Data and Dialer screen is also where you'll be able to perform mass actions. Mass actions include selecting your records either individually, by selecting all, or by selecting a page. You can then choose the \"move to\" option to move the selected contacts to a group, a list, or your internal Mojo Do Not Call (DNC) list. You can also assign contacts by assigning a manager or action plan, or choose to export your data. We also have a Find Duplicates option. This feature allows you to easily find any duplicates in your Mojo account. You can either link them or choose to delete them. Additionally, you have the option to create a contact manually. You can also print labels, letters, or just print out the contacts themselves. If you need to change which fields to display on the screen, you can do so by choosing \"Manage Columns.\" If you have an integration with a service like Constant Contact, there may be an integration button here that allows you to send data to that vendor from this screen. When managing your lists, you do have some other options. You can create a list rule, share or unshare a list (if you have lower access agents), edit the list name, or delete the list. We also have Calling Profiles. Calling profiles are used if you have lower access agents under your account who need a specific set of calling filters and settings. These agents would only be able to dial off of that calling profile. Some people also use calling profiles just to save their call settings, but it's mostly used for lower access agents. Finally, at the bottom of the screen, there’s the Import File button. The Data and Dialer screen is where you'll go to import your file if needed. This has been a video about the Data and Dialer screen. Remember, we offer live training sessions twice a day at 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. If you need additional support, you can always call our support line. Thanks so much, and I hope you have a great day!

    "content": "How to Use List Rules &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: In this video, I’m going to show you how to use and make list rules. List rules in Mojo are a great way to help you manage and organize your data. They allow automation to do some of the heavy lifting for you, which will definitely make things easier in the long run. This means less guesswork and fewer manual tasks. List rules can be set up to perform multiple different actions. These actions include moving contacts, scheduling calls, sending emails, and even deleting contacts. Creating a List Rule: The first step to creating a list rule is to click the three dots to the right of a list that you'd like to create the list rule for. Once I'm in the list rule creator, I can see if I have any list rules that I’ve already created. For example, I created one where the last call result equals \"contact.\" If that's the case, I want it to be moved to a hot lead. That’s just one general rule, but you can create multiple list rules for different actions. Here are a few examples of what you can do: If call attempts equal 5, then I want it to move to a group and mark it as \"Not Yet Interested.\" If a contact moves to a list, it can trigger an action plan, create a task, reset call attempts, send an email, or even delete the contact. Dynamic List Rules: Some people like to set up list rules that are more dynamic. For instance, if a contact reaches a certain status, it will automatically move from one list to another. For example, using the \"Status Change Date\" list rule, if a contact is older than 5 days, you can have it move to a 5-day-old expired list or a 5-day-old FSO list—whatever fits your needs. This feature gives you lots of options, and it can be very powerful in helping you manage your data. It takes the guesswork out of the process and keeps your database clean. This way, your leads will always move through your sales pipeline as you want, without you having to manually declutter or figure out what to do with leads on a list. Visual Indicators: Once I’ve created the list rule, you’ll see a little blue line to the left of any list that has a list rule applied. This indicates that there’s a rule on that list. You can then click the three dots again and choose \"List Rule\" to see the rule you’ve set up. I hope everyone out there gets a chance to take advantage of this great and powerful feature. It will make your time much more efficient and keep your sales pipeline flowing smoothly. Thanks so much for watching the video.

    "content": "How to Use the Neighborhood Search &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: Hello, in this video, I'm going to walk you through how to use the Neighborhood Search. The Neighborhood Search is one of Mojo's data products, and if you don't already have a subscription to it, you can navigate to the lead store at any time to subscribe. I've navigated to the Neighborhood Search, which you can access by clicking the link I just showed you on the homepage. However, you can also access it from the data and dialer screen. There will be a blue button that says \"Neighborhood Search.\" When I first come to the Neighborhood Search, it asks me if I want to grant permission to allow it to know my location. This is usually recommended, as it will zero in on the map to where your location is and make things a little bit easier for plotting the areas that you want. The Neighborhood Search is a very powerful tool that allows you to bring in data from just listed, just sold listings, for geo farming, just calling around high-valued neighborhoods, and we give you lots of tools to help you along the way. The first step that I would do once I come to the Neighborhood Search is to put in an address that I would want to search around. I’ll just do one locally around here. Once I've done that, I have the ability to choose how I want to search my area. So, I’ll have free-form plotting, radius, and you can get more specific with an individual street if you want to. I’ll start with the free-form plotting. As you can see, I can just place the plots on the map and then drag to contour to be more specific to the area that I'm looking for. You can zoom out on the map if you want to, to really get this specific area that you want. We give you the option over here to then choose radius plotting if you want to. I’ll show you the radius plotting now. Once I choose that, it gives me a circle. I can stretch the circle out by grabbing the small circles on the outside. I can also move the circle over by clicking on the center circle and dragging it wherever I need it to go. We keep track of the radius that you're doing when you are doing the radius plotting. We have a map option section here that will give you a little legend, so if you see any of these icons, you’ll know what they mean. You can delete your past mappings or manage them if needed. We also give you an assortment of different filters that you can work with. You can choose to include properties with no phones. Some people like to do mailers, and that's a good way to get a lot of mailers. You can also choose to select by property type. We’ve recently included land as an option as well. You can specify multi-units and the number of units. If you only want absentee owners, free and clear properties, and other filters, we’ve got you covered, including AVM, loan to value, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Once you have the area that you want, you’ll see the total contacts searched and the contacts matching the filters. By default, we do not allow the Do Not Call list. This will show you the total amount that was going to be imported. Once I have the area that I want, I then click \"Import.\" It just gives me an alert about what status I chose for my DNC scrubbing. I choose to understand, and here is where I would give it a list name. It lets me know if any of these contacts already exist in Mojo, and then I finish my import. It just told me that the 56 contacts were successfully imported. Now, I can go to my data to see my list, or I can go back to the map and do another search. This has been a walkthrough of the Mojo Neighborhood Search. Remember, we do have live trainings twice a day at 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and our support team is always standing by to help you out. Thank you so much, and I hope you make it a great day!

    "content": "How To Create A Sublist &lt;br&gt;Video Transcript: Hello! In this video, I'm going to walk you through how to make a sublist with Mojo. A sublist is a great tool to filter out an existing list and specify the pieces of information you want to focus on. You can create a sublist from any field that you have access to in Mojo. For example, here we have fields like \"Full Name,\" \"Property Address,\" and \"Property City.\" You can see additional fields when you scroll to the right on my screen. You can also add other available fields by choosing the \"Manage Columns\" option on the top right. Creating a Sublist: The first step to creating a sublist is to click on your list. For today’s example, I’m going to choose my \"Mojo Import Video One\" list. If you were to choose your properties list, you’d start there and filter by the different columns. But for today, I’ll use the Mojo Import Video list. In the past, when we had our sublist creator, it would take you to a completely different screen. But now, we’ve simplified the process. All you have to do is click on the list, and you’ll see the different columns with icons next to them. When you hover over these icons, they say \"Filter,\" so you know they’re the filter icons. Filtering the List: For this example, I’m going to click the filter icon and filter by the status of \"Expired.\" Now, I only see the expired contacts. If I want to save this filtered list as a sublist, I would click \"Save Sublist\" and name it. Now, you’ll see the sublist shows up right below the original list. Understanding Sublists: When you create a sublist, it doesn’t take the data out of the original list. It’s just a more specific version of that list. From here, you can start a dial session, print based on the specifics in that list, and manage your data more efficiently. It’s a very easy and powerful tool. Editing a Sublist: Maybe you want to edit this existing sublist. If you look, I’m selected on that sublist now, and I can add another filter. For instance, I want to filter by a date range, so I’ll select the ones from the 25th to the 25th and apply my filters. Now, I have a sublist with only those contacts from the 25th. If I want to save this, I can click \"Save Sublist.\" I’ll have the option to either save over the existing sublist or save it as a new sublist. I’m going to save it as \"Expired 11/25.\" Now, I have two sublists. Key Notes: Remember, the sublists are still part of the original list. They’re just more specific versions of it. You can create sublists based on multiple filters and values, which really helps when you need to focus on specific parts of your list. If you have a very large list and only want to focus on certain cities or dates, this feature is perfect for that. Essentially, you can filter and create sublists based on whatever you need with these columns. Thank you so much for watching this video about making a sublist. Remember, we have live trainings at 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern, Monday through Friday. We also have live support standing by, ready to help you out. Thank you again, and I hope you make it a great day!
