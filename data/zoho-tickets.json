This would work similar to how “Manage Mapping” functions in Neighborhood Search.</p><p>Sometimes I want to hit the same farm area again, but tighten or change the criteria (price range, beds/baths, equity, absentee, etc.) so I can run a more targeted list based on a different focus.</p><p>I think it would be a huge improvement and save a lot of time.<br></p><div><br></div><div>Thanks!</div>",

    "description": "<p>Hello MOJO Support Team,</p><p>I’m writing to formally report <strong>unauthorized access and charges</strong> on my MOJO account, as well as to document a <strong>poor customer service experience</strong> during my call with your representative, Romian.</p><p>I contacted support to review several subscriptions that appeared on my account. <strong>Only two people have access</strong> to this account: myself and my virtual assistant, Bella. Neither of us authorized these purchases.</p><p>The subscriptions in question appear to have been added in <strong>December and January</strong>, including data services that I did not enable. We have been using <strong>only the dialer</strong>, not MOJO data products. During the call, Romian was <strong>dismissive, contradictory, and not customer-service oriented</strong>, repeatedly attributing the charges to my VA despite being told clearly that neither of us made these purchases.</p><p>More concerning, <strong>immediately after ending the call</strong>, I received another charge notification for a <strong>one-year FSBO data subscription for Fort Bend County</strong>, which was also not authorized by me or my VA.</p><p>I am requesting the following:</p><ol><li>\n<p>A full <strong>audit and activity log</strong> of my account, including timestamps, IP addresses, and devices used when these subscriptions were added.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>A <strong>review and refund</strong> of all unauthorized charges.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Confirmation that my account access and billing permissions have been secured to prevent this from happening again.</p>\n</li></ol><p>I want to resolve this directly with MOJO. However, if this cannot be addressed promptly and professionally, I will move forward with a dispute through my credit card provider.</p><p>Please confirm receipt of this message and advise on next steps.</p><p>Thank you,<br></p><div>Nick&nbsp; Good</div>",

I wanted to reach out because Mojo has been a core part of our business for over five years now, and during that time we’ve naturally referred to quite a few <b>wholesalers and real estate operators</b> to your platform through conversations, coaching, and day-to-day work in this space.</p><p class=\"x_554139564p2\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times; min-height: 14px\"><br></p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">We’ve recently launched structured programs under Trinity Property Solutions Group, including Dials to Deals and Deal Flow Academy, where <b>new and scaling wholesalers</b> are being onboarded consistently. As part of these programs, we actively recommend the tools we personally use and trust—Mojo being one of them.</p><p class=\"x_554139564p2\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times; min-height: 14px\"><br></p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">With that in mind, I wanted to explore formalizing what we’re already doing organically. Specifically, we’d love to discuss a referral or affiliate-style partnership where referrals coming through TPSG can be tracked and rewarded in a more structured way (whether that’s referral credits, custom pricing for our students, or another model that makes sense on your side).</p><p class=\"x_554139564p2\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times; min-height: 14px\"><br></p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">Our goal is simple: continue sending <b>qualified, active wholesalers</b> to Mojo while creating a win-win relationship that supports growth on both ends.</p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">Let me know if this is something you’re open to discussing. I’d be happy to jump on a quick call and share more context around our programs and expected referral volume.</p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">Looking forward to connecting.</p><p class=\"x_554139564p2\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times; min-height: 14px\"><br></p><p class=\"x_554139564p1\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-kerning: auto; font-feature-settings: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Times\">Warmly,<br>The TPSG Team<br>Rio &amp; Jenn</p></div>",

Often times during a dialing session, you can see right away that a property is already sold/listed/or just does not warrant a call for whatever reason. However, you have to wait for someone to answer or the voicemail to pick up to change the status. It wastes a lot of time. It seems like we should just be able to change the status at any point. The only thing we can do now is skip it the lead. But then we have to go back and search it and then change the status. That is a major time drain when having to do this for multiple leads. We should be able to just change the status right away and move on to the next lead.&nbsp;</div>",

I'm dialing expireds from Colorado, and normally the screen turns green every couple minutes with someone on the line. Currently I have spoken to only a couple people in 2 hours, triple dialing from two accounts on two computers. I have tried rebooting my wifi, using different headphones, different caller IDs, and clearing my cache. I have no idea why it's so extremely slow, but it appears to be dialing as normal. Please help me fix this issue. Thanks!<br></div>",

For example, I have 5 actual leads that I integrated to follow up boss, but I also marked three of them as Hot Leads within mojo. My 5 leads were reflected as 8 leads within the Mojo dashboard. I understand from now on, I should only do one or the other, but now that I've fixed the mistake of \"double tagging\" these leads, the dashboard does not reflect the reduction in leads and still shows an amount that is too high. How do I get the dashboard to reflect accurate numbers in terms of the lead count - especially after making changes from within Mojo.</div>",

We tested Mojo hoping it would help increase our pickup rate, but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.</p><p><strong>1. Limited number availability:</strong><br>\nThere are very few numbers available for Las Vegas. We’ve submitted multiple requests, but we haven’t received any updates on when more numbers will be available. This affects our call routing since we don’t have enough numbers to rotate.</p><p><strong>2. Whitelisting delay:</strong><br>\nThe whitelisting process takes too long. When we contacted support, we were told that once the caller ID is whitelisted, the “spam likely” flag would be removed. However, that didn’t happen.</p><p><strong>3. Low pickup rate:</strong><br>\nThe pickup rate is extremely low. We rarely get anyone to answer calls from the lists we downloaded using the Neighborhood Search feature.</p><p>Because of these issues, we’ve had to switch back to another dialer as Mojo isn’t working for our needs.</p><p>Please let us know how we can resolve this. We’re hoping to receive a refund since the service did not perform as expected.</p><p>We appreciate your immediate attention to this.</p>",

I have my team calling through Mojo as well, and I’ve set up seats for each of them. I just have a couple of questions regarding setup and functionality:</p><ol><li>\n<p><strong>Filtering Expired Listings:</strong><br>\nIs there a way to filter a list specifically for expired listings over $1,000,000 in value? Ideally, I’d like the expired listings that populate in the list to only include those priced above $1M.</p>\n</li><li><p><strong>Follow Up Boss Integration:</strong><br>\nWhen my team is calling and identifies a prospect that becomes a lead, we use Follow Up Boss for lead management. I have the integration set up on my end, but since each team member has their own collections and user profiles in Follow Up Boss, I’m unsure how that works for them.</p><ul><li>\n<p>Do they need to connect their own Mojo account to Follow Up Boss individually?</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Or will leads they mark as “qualified” in Mojo automatically route into Follow Up Boss under their respective profiles?</p>\n</li></ul></li></ol><p>Any guidance or documentation you could share to help us streamline this workflow would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thank you for your time and support,<br>\n<strong>Tom McKenna</strong></p>",

    "description": "<div><p>Hi Mojo Support Team,</p><p>I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been a long-time Mojo user since 2015 and currently manage a team that relies heavily on your dialer and reporting features for performance tracking.</p><p>I wanted to request an update to the <strong>report export format</strong> — particularly for the <strong>Session Report</strong> and <strong>Call Detail Report</strong>. These currently export in a <strong>legacy .XLS format</strong>, which causes compatibility issues when sharing and analyzing data through modern tools and automation systems.</p><p>If possible, could you enable exports in a <strong>clean XLSX or CSV format</strong> with consistent headers and sections consolidated into one table (rather than repeating headers per list/campaign)?<br>\nThis would make it significantly easier to integrate Mojo’s data into team analytics dashboards and third-party AI reporting tools we use internally.</p><p>Thank you for considering this request — Mojo has been an incredible part of our daily workflow, and this small improvement would go a long way in streamlining team reporting.</p><p>Warm regards,<br>\n<strong>Bryan Dale</strong><br>\nAssociate Real Estate Broker | eXp Realty</p></div>",

The reason for this is because im planning on cancelling my FUB subscription and using Mojo as my. \"master\" database.

Should I add the contacts to a new group in Mojo so that they're still on this account even after I delete my FUB account and the syndication integration no longer is active?</div>",

He provided his email and I was able to locate that account that was cancelled back in 2024 as he stated. He then provided me the last 4 digits of his previous credit card (5083) and I was able to locate the accounts that were billing him. He did admit in our earlier conversation that he used Virtual Assistants to do calling for him before but he stopped using them awhile back. He is denying that the account is his even though the emails all match his company name.&nbsp;<br><br>I was able to cancel the accounts that were billing him to ensure he doesn't get billed in the future. However, He is requesting to be reimbursed from the date that he cancelled the account...</div><div><br></div><div>N.B. He is under the impression that he is only being billed by 1 account.

However to resolve it, I have refresh my browser and it works again.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRw00Y7Sdsf-YvJ_E1KMXBgttG1idFoi/view?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRw00Y7Sdsf-YvJ_E1KMXBgttG1idFoi/view?usp=drive_link</a></div><div><br></div><div>Monieb</div>",
