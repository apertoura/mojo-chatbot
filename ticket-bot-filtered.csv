Based on the examples I see, Console Logs are used when users experience problems like: - **API timeouts and connection issues** - Such as severe latency, call failures, or slow response times from Mojo's servers - **Session management problems** - Like sessions ending unexpectedly during live calls or needing session timeout adjustments The Console Log appears to be a diagnostic tool that generates a unique URL (like the examples shown: `https://app41.mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/671020/` or `https://app451.mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/101794/`) that contains technical information about your account's activity and any errors. When you contact Mojo support with technical issues, they may ask you to provide or generate a Console Log to help them diagnose the problem more effectively. If you're experiencing technical difficulties with Mojo, you would typically contact support and they can guide you on how to access or generate the appropriate Console Log for your specific issue. Is there a particular technical issue you're experiencing that might require Console Log diagnostics?",5,2,

Here are the most common reasons why whitelisting submissions get rejected and how to resolve them: ## Common Rejection Reasons & Solutions: **Caller ID Registration Name Format Issues:** - The name must follow specific formatting guidelines provided on the whitelisting page - Make sure you're using the exact format shown in the examples - Avoid special characters, abbreviations, or informal names **Incomplete Information:** - Ensure all required fields are filled out completely - Double-check that your phone number is entered correctly - Verify you've agreed to all terms and conditions **Number Already in Process:** - If your number is already being processed by another service, it may be rejected - Wait for any existing whitelisting processes to complete before resubmitting ## How to Resubmit: 1. **Navigate to Settings** from the bottom left of your Mojo dashboard 2. **Select Caller ID/Mojo Caller ID** from the left menu 3. **Find your number** and click the Submit button under the Whitelisted column 4. **Carefully review the format requirements** for the Caller ID Registration Name 5. **Enter the name following the exact guidelines** shown on the page 6. **Check the agreement box** and click Save ## Important Notes: - The registration name appears to approximately 10-15% of your contacts - Its primary purpose is to identify your number as trusted to phone carriers - Full whitelisting typically takes around 8 days to complete - Your number will be color-coded to show its current whitelisting status If you continue to experience rejections after following the proper format, please check that your number isn't already whitelisted or in process with another provider.",5,2,

This is a frustrating situation, and I'll help you troubleshoot this. Here are the immediate steps to resolve dialer connection issues: **First, verify your connection method:** 1. **Check your dialing server connection** - When you start a calling session, you need to connect to the dialing server using one of these methods: - Wait for an incoming call at your specified number (if using the ""Call Me"" feature) - Call the provided phone number and enter your PIN when prompted 2. **Restart your calling session:** - Navigate to Data & Dialer - Select your target list - Click the Power Dialer button - Configure your call settings - Click ""Start Dialing"" - Ensure you properly connect to the dialing server **Additional troubleshooting steps:** - Close and restart your browser completely - Try using a different browser - Clear your browser cache and cookies - Check that you're logged in as the account owner - Verify your internet connection is stable - If using the ""Call Me"" feature, ensure the phone number in your account is correct and available **If the issue persists:** Since this is an urgent matter affecting your active subscription, and basic troubleshooting hasn't resolved it after 2+ hours, this may require technical investigation of your specific account setup or server connectivity. Try the connection steps above first, and if you're still unable to connect, this will need immediate technical support attention to check your account configuration and server connectivity status.",5,2,

If they're not routing correctly: 1. **Confirm Mojo Voice is Active** - Check that your Mojo Voice subscription is active and properly configured 2. **Verify Caller ID Association** - Make sure your caller ID is properly linked to your Mojo Voice line 3. **Check Integration Settings** - Ensure the caller ID and Mojo Voice are configured to work together ## Troubleshooting Steps If callbacks still aren't routing properly: - **Contact Support** - Since this involves the technical integration between Mojo Voice and your caller ID routing, you'll need Mojo support to check the backend configuration - **Verify Phone Settings** - Ensure your phone settings aren't blocking or redirecting calls - **Test the Setup** - Make a test call and have someone call back to verify the routing The routing should work automatically once both services are properly configured together.

Questi","2026-01-30T18:51:22.000Z","Closed","To remove tags from leads in Mojo when you're connected to FUB through the API, you'll need to work with the contact groups system since that's how Mojo manages lead organization and tagging. Here's how to handle this workflow: ## Understanding Mojo's Tag System In Mojo, leads are organized using contact groups rather than traditional tags. When contacts are assigned to groups you've designated as ""lead groups,"" they're automatically tagged as leads in your reports and tracking. ## Removing Lead Status/Tags To remove a lead tag or change a contact's status in Mojo: 1. **Go to Data & Dialer** section 2. **Find the contact** in your Smart List or search for them 3. **Edit the contact's group assignment** by removing them from the designated lead groups 4. **Move them to a different group** (like ""Contacted"" or ""Not Interested"") based on your call outcome ## Workflow Recommendation Since you're calling from a Smart List populated by FUB tags: 1. **After speaking with a lead**, immediately update their group assignment in Mojo 2. **Move them to an appropriate follow-up group** based on the call outcome 3. This will remove their ""lead"" tag in Mojo's reporting system 4. The API connection should sync this change back to FUB, though the exact behavior depends on your API configuration ## Alternative Approach You could also set up additional contact groups in Mojo like: - ""Contacted - Hot"" - ""Contacted - Warm"" - ""Contacted - Cold"" - ""Do Not Call"" This way you're not just removing the lead tag, but categorizing them for proper follow-up without having to manage this in FUB directly. The key is using Mojo's group system to manage lead status changes, which should sync through your API connection.",5,2,
