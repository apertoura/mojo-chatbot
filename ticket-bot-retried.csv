This is a common issue that can usually be resolved quickly. Here are the troubleshooting steps to get you back up and running: ## Immediate Solutions to Try: **1. Check Your Connection Method** - If using ""Call Me"" feature: Ensure you're waiting for the incoming call at your specified number - If calling in: Make sure you're dialing the correct server number and entering your PIN when prompted **2. Browser and System Reset** - Close your browser completely and reopen it - Clear your browser cache and cookies - Try using a different browser (Chrome is recommended) - Restart your computer if the issue persists **3. Verify Your Setup** - Confirm your dialer settings are properly configured - Check that your Call Settings show the correct Caller ID - Ensure your account subscription is active **4. Connection Troubleshooting** - Try disconnecting and reconnecting to the dialing server - If the server connection fails, wait 2-3 minutes and try again - Check your internet connection stability **5. Account-Specific Checks** - Verify your account has active dialing credits - Ensure no recent billing issues that might affect service ## If Still Not Working: Since this is marked urgent and affects your business operations, if these steps don't resolve the issue within 10-15 minutes, this may indicate a server-side problem that requires immediate technical support intervention.

If this isn't happening, here's how to resolve it: ### Current Setup Verification First, verify your current configuration: 1. **Check Caller ID Settings:** - Go to Settings → Caller ID/Mojo Caller ID - Ensure your Mojo Caller ID is properly configured and verified 2. **Verify Mojo Voice Setup:** - Confirm Mojo Voice is active on your account - Check that calls are routing through Mojo Voice correctly ### Troubleshooting Callback Routing If callbacks aren't routing properly to your Mojo Voice number: 1. **Contact Support for Routing Configuration:** - This type of routing setup between Mojo Caller ID and Mojo Voice may require backend configuration - Support can verify that your callback routing is properly mapped 2. **Check Call Flow Settings:** - Ensure there are no conflicting caller ID configurations - Verify that your primary caller ID isn't overriding the Mojo Voice routing ### Expected Behavior With proper setup: - Outbound calls display your Mojo Caller ID to recipients - Return calls automatically route to your Mojo Voice line - You receive callbacks through the Mojo system rather than your personal phone Since this involves the integration between two Mojo services, I recommend contacting Mojo support directly to verify your account's routing configuration and ensure the callback flow is properly established between your Mojo Caller ID and Mojo Voice services.",5,2,
