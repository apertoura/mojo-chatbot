"13333","Dialer issue","","2026-02-04T17:17:57.000Z","Open","I can help you troubleshoot your dialer issue. Here are the most common problems and solutions: ## Network Connection Issues Make sure these network ports are open on your firewall: - **20708** (TCP/IP) - **20718** (TCP/IP) - **20808** (TCP/IP) - **20818** (TCP/IP) Check with your network administrator or IT department to ensure these ports allow both inbound and outbound traffic. ## Caller ID Verification Problems If you can't start dialing, your Caller ID might not be verified: - Turn OFF ""Do Not Disturb"" on your phone - Turn OFF ""Ignore Unknown Callers"" - Make sure calls aren't going straight to voicemail - Check your signal strength ## Basic Troubleshooting Steps 1. **Refresh your browser** and try again 2. **Check your internet connection** 3. **Restart your computer** and network equipment 4. **Clear your browser cache** 5. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) ## For Mojo Voice Users If you're using Mojo Voice ($30/month add-on): - Allow microphone access when your browser prompts you - Check that your headset and microphone are properly connected - Test your audio connection in the dialer settings Can you tell me more specifically what's happening when you try to use the dialer? Are you getting an error message, or is it not connecting at all?",5,2,

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this: **Immediate Check:** 1. Verify your dialer connection method: - If using ""Call Me"" feature, confirm the correct phone number is set in your account settings - If calling in with a PIN, make sure you're dialing the correct Mojo server number **Phone System Configuration:** 1. Check if your office phone system has any call forwarding or routing rules that might be intercepting outbound calls 2. Verify that your phone line isn't configured to route certain number patterns to your front desk **Account Settings Verification:** 1. Go to your Mojo account settings and confirm: - Your registered phone number matches the line you're using - No incorrect forwarding numbers are set up - Your Call Settings are properly configured **Testing Steps:** 1. Try connecting to the dialer from a different phone line to isolate if it's a system-wide issue or specific to your current setup 2. Test with a mobile phone instead of your office line to see if the problem persists If the issue continues after these checks, the console log you mentioned will be helpful for technical support to trace the exact call routing path and identify where the misdirection is occurring. The routing issue appears to be on the connection side rather than the target number selection.",5,2,

However, there are some important considerations: **What Shows on the Map:** - Residential addresses - these work best and most reliably - Business addresses - these will also appear if they have valid street addresses **What May Not Show Well:** - P.O. Boxes - these won't have specific map locations since they're not street addresses - Addresses with incomplete or improperly formatted location data **For Best Results:** Make sure your addresses are properly formatted with separate fields for: - Street address - City - State - Zip code Avoid importing all address elements into a single field, as this can affect how well the mapping feature works. So yes, business addresses should show up on the map as long as they're complete street addresses with proper formatting. The key is having accurate, complete address data rather than the property type itself.",5,2,

Check the box to agree to the terms and click Save **Important Notes:** - The Caller ID Registration Name will appear to approximately 10-15% of your contacts - Its primary purpose is to identify your number as trusted to phone carriers - Full whitelisting and CNAM updates can take varying amounts of time depending on the phone carrier, but typically complete after approximately 8 days - Your number will be color-coded in the system to show its current whitelisting status This whitelisting process with your personalized name should help improve your contact rates by displaying your actual name instead of the generic ""Real Estate Agent"" designation that's currently hurting your pickup rate.",5,2,
"13329","Triple dialer subscription",,"2026-02-04T16:26:35.000Z","Open","The triple dialer subscription allows you to dial with multiple lines simultaneously, increasing your calling efficiency. Here's what you need to know: ## Triple Dialer Features **Multiple Lines**: Instead of dialing one number at a time, the triple dialer can dial up to 3 lines simultaneously, allowing you to connect with more prospects faster. **Line Management**: When using Click-to-Call mode, the system automatically reduces the number of lines to 1. When switching back to Power Dialer mode, make sure to check and reset your line count if needed, as the system retains the single-line setting from your previous Click to Call session. ## Managing Your Triple Dialer Subscription To modify your dialer subscription: 1. Click the Account icon in the bottom left corner of Mojo 2. Select **Subscriptions** from the left navigation panel 3. Find your Dialer Subscription at the top of the page 4. Use the plus (+) or minus (-) icons to add or remove services **Important billing notes:** - Adding services: Costs are prorated based on your current billing cycle - Removing services: Changes take effect immediately with no prorated refund - Best practice: Wait until the day before your next bill date to remove services to maximize your paid time ## License Requirements Each agent who wants to use the dialer needs their own dialer license. If you have multiple agents dialing simultaneously, you'll need multiple licenses (one per agent). If you're getting licensing errors, it may be because another agent is using an available license or you have multiple browser sessions open.",5,2,

"13327","Request to speak with a manager.","He is getting random dead air calls. If he calls them directly, the call goes t","2026-02-04T14:58:50.000Z","Open","I understand the customer's frustration with the dead air calls and their request to speak with a manager. This is indeed a challenging situation that requires management attention. **The Technical Issue:** The customer is experiencing a common problem where calls connect through the Mojo system but result in dead air, while direct calls to the same numbers work fine. This typically indicates that carriers are treating the Mojo-routed calls differently, likely due to spam filtering or call blocking at the carrier level. **Why This Happens:** - Carriers increasingly use sophisticated spam detection that can flag calls from dialing platforms - The routing path through Mojo's system may trigger different carrier behaviors than direct calls - Canadian carriers may have additional filtering mechanisms **Whitelisting Limitation:** You're correct that whitelisting has limited effectiveness for Canadian customers, as our whitelisting service primarily works with US carriers. **Manager Escalation Needed:** This customer should be escalated to a manager because: 1. They're experiencing a technical issue that significantly impacts their service functionality 2. They're requesting pricing concessions due to service performance 3. Standard troubleshooting hasn't resolved the core connectivity issue **Suggested Next Steps for Management:** - Review the customer's call logs to identify patterns in the dead air calls - Consider technical solutions or alternative routing options - Evaluate if any service adjustments are appropriate given the technical limitations The customer's phone number (647) 205-2012 should be escalated to management for both the technical issue resolution and the pricing discussion.",5,2,

The limit resets automatically after the 15-minute cooldown period, and then you can resume using these features normally. Since you mentioned you've been a long-time client and haven't seen this before, it's possible that: - You may have been doing more printing/emailing than usual in a short timeframe - The system limits may have been recently implemented or adjusted - There could have been multiple rapid requests that triggered the safeguard The good news is this is temporary - just wait out the 15 minutes and you'll be able to continue accessing and printing your data as normal.

The subscription gives you access to the dialer functionality - you don't need to specifically ""assign"" it to activate it. To start using your dialer: 1.

The difference you're seeing is likely due to how Mojo counts dials in different contexts: **During your session**, the counter typically shows: - Contacts you've actually connected with or attempted to reach - Successful dial attempts that went through **In the session report**, the count includes: - All dial attempts, including busy signals, disconnected numbers, and network retries - Multiple attempts to the same number if using features like Call Hammer - System-level dial attempts that may not have been visible during your active session The session report provides a more comprehensive view of all dialing activity that occurred during your session, which is why the number is typically higher than what you see on your screen during active dialing. This discrepancy is normal system behavior and doesn't indicate any issues with your dialing session or reporting accuracy. Both numbers are correct - they're just measuring different aspects of your dialing activity. If you have specific questions about interpreting your session reports or want to understand exactly what activities are being counted, I'd be happy to help explain further.",5,2,

The standard Mojo Caller ID setup is designed so you can make outbound calls with the Mojo number as your caller ID while still receiving return calls on your original phone, but the routing can be customized upon request.

Use the text editing toolbar to highlight the text 3. Change the font family using the formatting options 4. Make sure to apply the changes to all text blocks **Test Your Changes:** After making these adjustments, send another test email to verify the font appears correctly. The issue is likely that either the default template font is set to a monospace font (which creates that typewriter appearance), or individual text blocks have font formatting that's overriding your template settings. If the problem persists after trying these steps, the issue might be with how your email client is rendering the fonts, but adjusting both the template default font and individual block formatting should resolve it.",5,2,

Check Your Mojo Voice Integration** - Confirm that your Mojo Voice service is active and properly connected to your Mojo account - Verify that the Caller ID number you're using is associated with your Mojo Voice setup **3. Review Call Routing Settings** - In your Power Dialer settings, ensure you've selected the correct Caller ID for your dialing sessions - The routing should automatically direct callbacks to the number you're dialing from **4. Test the Setup** - Make a test call to a known number (like your personal phone) - Have someone call back that Caller ID number to verify it routes correctly to your Mojo Voice system If callbacks are still not routing properly after checking these settings, there may be a configuration issue between your Caller ID and Mojo Voice integration that requires technical support to resolve. The routing should work automatically once both services are properly configured and linked. Make sure both your Caller ID verification is complete and your Mojo Voice service is active - both need to be functioning for proper callback routing.",5,2,

Here are a few workarounds you can consider: **Quick Solutions:** - When answering unknown calls, you can quickly ask ""What address were you calling about?"" to help identify the property/lead - Keep your phone near your computer when possible during calling sessions so you can quickly search the number in Mojo - Consider using a dedicated business line with a different caller ID instead of your personal number **Manual Lookup:** If you do have access to your Mojo account when you receive the call, you can: 1. Go to Settings → Do Not Call → DNC Scrubbing 2. Enter the caller's phone number in the search field 3. This will help you locate if they're in your system **Future Consideration:** You might want to suggest this as a feature request to Mojo, as caller identification for return calls would be valuable for many users who use personal numbers for outbound calling.

Let me help you troubleshoot this issue. Here are several steps to resolve session drops: **Immediate Solutions:** 1. **Use the Pause Feature Instead of Letting Sessions Drop** - If you need to take a break or handle something urgent, click the ""Pause"" button in the dialer toolbar - This keeps your session active and maintains your place in the calling list - Click ""Resume"" when you're ready to continue dialing 2. **Proper Session Management** - Always end sessions properly by completing your current call first - Click ""Pause"" before handling any interruptions - Use ""Resume"" to continue from where you left off **Potential Causes and Solutions:** - **Internet Connection**: Even though you're using a landline for calls, Mojo runs through your internet browser. Ensure you have a stable internet connection - **Browser Issues**: Try refreshing your browser or clearing your cache - **Session Timeout**: Extended idle periods can cause automatic disconnections **Alternative Connection Method:** Consider trying **Mojo Voice**, which provides a dedicated browser-based voice connection directly to Mojo's servers without needing your landline or third-party apps. This can provide a more stable connection. **If Problems Persist:** The drops you're experiencing aren't normal behavior. I recommend contacting Mojo support directly with: - Specific times the drops occurred - Your browser type and version - Any error messages you received This will help them identify if there's a system issue that needs addressing.

To set this up, you would need to: 1. **Get approved as a vendor** - Contact Mojo support at 877-859-6656 to discuss becoming an approved lead vendor for data posting 2. **Obtain the client's Posting PIN** - Once approved, Potomac Custom Remodeling would need to provide their unique 10-digit Posting PIN from their Mojo account (found in their Account section - only visible to account owners) 3. **Authentication process** - Mojo would authenticate your platform and enable direct lead posting to their account Currently approved vendors include companies like The Redx, Vulcan 7, Cole Information, Telelisting, and others.

Each carrier has independent spam detection systems that can override whitelisting status. **Immediate Steps:** 1. **Contact Mojo Support Directly** - Since this involves carrier-specific spam labeling while your numbers show as properly whitelisted, you'll need direct technical assistance to: - Verify the whitelisting status with carriers - Submit rewhitelisting requests if needed - Check for any carrier-specific issues 2. **Document the Issue** - Keep records of: - Which specific numbers are affected - Which carriers are showing spam likely - Screenshots of the Mojo whitelisting status **Long-term Solutions:** Consider upgrading to **Mojo Caller ID**, which provides: - Stir/Shaken certification with attestation level A - Verified caller ID that carriers recognize as legitimate - Higher trust and deliverability rates - Reduced false spam tagging **Best Practices While Resolving:** - Vary your calling patterns - Keep call durations reasonable - Avoid rapid-fire calling to the same area codes - Monitor your contact rates for improvements Contact Mojo support immediately with your account details and the specific numbers experiencing issues.

Create a separate column to track which numbers were marked as DNC 3. Import the cleaned file normally ## Option 2: Add Numbers to DNC After Import After importing your list, you'll need to manually add the DNC numbers: **To add individual numbers:** 1.

However, you can: 1. **Monitor your overall daily dial volume** through the Dialing Stats section (accessible from your homepage top navigation) 2. **Manage your phone number rotation** - if you have multiple phone numbers, they should rotate automatically, but some numbers may indeed get used more heavily than others as you've noticed **Recommendations for Spam Protection:** - Keep track of your daily dial totals and stay within reasonable limits (many experts suggest 80-120 calls per number per day maximum) - Consider spreading your calls across different times of day - If you notice one number getting flagged more often, you might want to reduce its usage manually For more specific dial limiting features or phone number usage tracking, I'd recommend contacting Mojo support directly, as this seems like a feature request that could benefit many users concerned about spam flagging.",5,2,

Unfortunately, Mojo doesn't have built-in automated tools for the bulk duplicate management you're describing. Here's what you can do within Mojo's current capabilities: ## Current Mojo Options: **For Manual Duplicate Removal:** - Use the Data & Dialer screen to select multiple contacts - Use filters to help identify duplicates by address or name - Select contacts and use ""Move to"" button to move older duplicates to a separate list - Then delete that list entirely **For Adding Property Information:** You can import additional data using Mojo's import feature: 1. Click ""Choose File"" and select your property data file (XLS, XLSX, or CSV) 2. In Step 2, choose to add to your existing list 3. Map the property columns (AVM, Last Sold, etc.) to appropriate fields 4. The system will match records and add the new data ## Recommended Approach: Since Mojo doesn't have automated duplicate consolidation, you might need to: 1. **Export your data** from Mojo 2. **Clean it externally** using Excel/Google Sheets or data cleaning software to: - Identify duplicates by address - Consolidate phone numbers for same property owners - Keep only the most recent records 3. **Re-import the cleaned data** back into Mojo This would be much more efficient than trying to clean 9K duplicates manually within Mojo's interface. Would you like specific guidance on any of these steps, or help with the import process for adding your property data?",5,2,

Here's how it works: ### What is Caller ID Whitelisting? - A free service from Mojo that counters ""Spam Likely"" and STIR SHAKEN identification - Mojo's partners monitor for spam tagging or call blocking and take action to clean your number - Helps establish your number as trustworthy across carrier networks ### How to Whitelist Your Caller ID **For Existing Caller IDs:** 1. Navigate to **Settings** from the bottom left of your Mojo dashboard 2. Select **Caller ID/Mojo Caller ID** from the left menu 3. Find your number and click the **Submit** button under the Whitelisted column 4. Check the box to have your Caller ID Whitelisted 5. Enter your **Caller ID Registration Name** (this appears to about 10-15% of your contacts and must follow the specific format shown on the page) 6. Check the box to agree to the terms and click **Save** **For New Caller IDs:** When adding a new Caller ID, you'll be prompted during setup to whitelist it following the same steps above. ### Processing Time - Full whitelisting takes varying amounts of time depending on the phone carrier - Typically complete after approximately 8 days - Your number will be color-coded in the system to show its current whitelisting status ### Benefits - Improved contact rates - Reduced spam flagging - Enhanced caller reputation - Better call deliverability Whitelisted numbers significantly improve your chances of calls being answered and help maintain your professional reputation.",5,2,
"13211","Credit","Hi, I thought my bill date was the end of the month. I was hoping you can extend a one time curtesy and credit me the one user i just removed. Thank you in advance. Dani","2026-01-30T14:39:51.000Z","Closed","I understand you were expecting your bill date to be at the end of the month and would like a courtesy credit for the user you just removed. Unfortunately, according to Mojo's billing policy, when you remove services from your Dialer subscription, the changes take effect immediately with no prorated refund. This is different from adding services, which are prorated based on your current billing cycle. For future reference, the best practice is to wait until the day before your next bill date to remove services - this way you can maximize the time you've already paid for. For billing adjustments or courtesy credits, you'll need to contact Mojo support directly at 877-859-6656, as account representatives can review your specific situation and determine what options may be available to you. Your current bill date and subscription details can be viewed in your Subscriptions page by clicking the Account icon in the bottom left corner of Mojo and selecting Subscriptions.",5,2,

To properly cancel your Mojo account, you need to: 1. **Log in as the account owner** using a computer 2. **Select ""Account""** in the top right of the Mojo screen 3. **Click the ""Subscriptions"" tab** on the left side 4. **Click the ""Cancel"" button** 5. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to complete the process **Important details about cancellation:** - Your cancellation takes effect **after your next billing date** - not immediately - You can continue using the platform until that billing date - The system may prevent you from deleting your payment method until the cancellation fully processes **Why you can't delete your payment method yet:** Since your cancellation only takes effect after your next billing date, Mojo likely keeps your payment method on file until that final billing cycle completes. **To confirm your cancellation status:** Check your Subscriptions page - it should show that cancellation is pending and display when it will take effect. If you completed the cancellation steps through your account dashboard, your cancellation should be properly processed and you won't be charged beyond your next billing date. The payment method restriction is likely just a system safeguard until the cancellation fully processes.",5,2,

This affects multiple users and results in incomplete calling sessions where leads remain in the list even after you think you've gone through them all. Here are some workarounds while this issue is being addressed: **Immediate Solutions:** 1. **Use the main Data and Dialer screen instead** - Navigate to your calendar contacts through the Data and Dialer interface rather than using the calendar view's next arrow 2. **Manual lead selection** - Instead of using the next arrow, close each lead and manually select the next one from your list 3. **Double-check your list** - Always return to your calendar contacts list to verify no leads were skipped before ending your calling session **Best Practice:** Since this is affecting your daily productivity, I recommend primarily using the Data and Dialer screen for systematic calling through your calendar contacts. This gives you better control over lead progression and ensures you don't miss anyone. The skipping behavior appears to be a navigation bug specific to the calendar interface's next arrow functionality. Your sales assistant's confirmation of the same issue helps validate this is a system-wide problem rather than a browser or user-specific issue. Make sure to complete your calling sessions by manually verifying your calendar contacts list is fully cleared to ensure no follow-ups are missed.",5,2,
