Since you haven't described the specific problem you're experiencing, let me cover the most common dialer issues and their solutions: ## Network Connectivity Issues If you're having trouble connecting to the dialer, ensure these network ports are open on your firewall: - **20708 TCP/IP** - **20808 TCP/IP** - **20718 TCP/IP** - **20818 TCP/IP** Make sure your firewall allows both inbound and outbound traffic on these ports, and check that any VPN or proxy isn't blocking them. ## Caller ID Verification Problems If you can't verify your Caller ID: - Turn OFF ""Do Not Disturb"" on your phone - Turn OFF ""Ignore Unknown Callers"" - Ensure calls aren't going straight to voicemail - Check your carrier settings and signal strength ## Power Dialer Setup Issues Before starting a calling session, verify you've completed: - Account subscription configuration - Dialer settings setup - Data import to your Mojo account ## Audio Issues (If Using Mojo Voice) - Check that your browser has microphone permissions enabled - Verify your headset and microphone connections - Test your audio connection in the dialer interface ## General Troubleshooting Steps 1. Restart your computer and network equipment 2. Test your general internet connectivity 3. Check for additional firewall rules or security software blocking the connection Could you describe the specific error message or behavior you're seeing? That would help me give you more targeted troubleshooting steps.",5,2,
"13332","Mojo Console Log","the dialer is calling our front desk even though it says its dialing this 509 number https://app281.mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/173645/","2026-02-04T17:05:34.000Z","Closed","I can see from your support tickets that Mojo Console Log refers to diagnostic logs that help troubleshoot technical issues with your Mojo account. Based on the examples I see, console logs are generated when users experience problems like: - API timeouts and connectivity issues - Session timeouts during live calls - Performance problems or call failures These logs contain technical diagnostic information that helps Mojo's support team identify and resolve issues. The logs are typically accessed through URLs that follow this pattern: `https://app[number].mojosells.com/admin/maintenance/consolelog/[account-number]/` If you're experiencing technical issues with Mojo and need to generate or access console logs, I'd recommend: 1. **Contact Mojo Support** directly through your support ticket system 2. **Describe your specific issue** (connection problems, session timeouts, call failures, etc.) 3. **Include your account number** if you have it 4. The support team can then access the appropriate console logs to diagnose your issue Is there a specific technical problem you're experiencing that might require console log analysis? I can help guide you on the best way to report it to support.",5,2,
